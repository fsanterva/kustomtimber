There’s much more to timber flooring services than just providing high-quality floorboards. They offer a range of services related to timber flooring which can help keep your floors looking their best and offer specialised services for customised projects. Today, we’ll share the range of services you can be offered for your timber flooring.
<h2>Precision installation</h2>
Choosing your floorboards is only part of the journey – you also need to get them installed. To ensure that you get the best results possible, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="https://kustomtimber.com.au/services/installation/">timber flooring services include professional installation</a></strong></span> by qualified experts. Although you may want to try your hand at DIY installation, remember that there’s an art to getting your flooring perfect and you want a finished product that will stand the test of time.
<h2>Renew your old floors</h2>
If you have existing floors that aren’t looking their best due to accumulated damage, your timber flooring service can help. One of the most popular timber flooring services is floor sanding to restore your floorboards and have them looking like new again. Getting a professional in for this task means less hassle and a precision final result. They’ll also be able to advise you on what to do if you have more serious damage.
<h2>Give your timber a new look</h2>
If you’re not happy with the look of your floorboards, you don’t have to live with it. Instead, you can get the experts in for a new stain and finish so your timber floors better suit your home. For example, if you don’t like the high-gloss finish on your floors or are tired of the too-yellow tone, simply get the experts in to advise on a transformation.
<h2>Bespoke stairs</h2>
Timber flooring services don’t just stick to flooring – they can also create timber staircases to suit your home. Timber is the perfect choice for stairs due to its durability, easy maintenance, and aesthetic appeal. You’ll be able to choose timber which suits the style of your home for a staircase that can stand up to daily wear and tear.
<h2>Stunning parquetry</h2>
Parquetry uses timber tiles to create a mosaic pattern on the floor and is a stunning way to create feature flooring in your home. Of course, installing parquetry takes a lot of skill and your timber flooring company has the expertise and craftsmanship to deliver a unique finished product. Whether you want a traditional herringbone pattern or something completely different, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="https://kustomtimber.com.au/services/parquetry/">parquetry flooring</a></strong></span> is a beautiful design choice for your home.
