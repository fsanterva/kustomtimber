Your flooring can make or break the style of your home. And with timber flooring, especially, there are a myriad of styles and finishes to choose from, which can get quite overwhelming. But sometimes the available options don’t quite achieve the look that you really want, and with your home, you want to make sure that you get the specifics down pat. When this happens, it may be a good idea to check out <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="https://kustomtimber.com.au/product-category/outback/">whitewash flooring</a></strong></span> as an option! Sometimes hardwood flooring finishes can be too striking and dark, but whitewashing your floors can go a long way in softening the look and brightening up the room.
<h2>How to Whitewash Oak Floors</h2>
Whitewashing floors can be an arduous process, especially for beginners. As with big changes in the home, it’s always best to consult a contractor for their services in order to ensure that you achieve the effect that you are going for. Whitewashing especially entails tricky steps that require finesse and experience and can take a long time if you choose to DIY it. It will require sanding the floorboards - which may be tricky especially if you have engineered <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flooring" rel="nofollow"><strong>flooring</strong></a></span> which typically has a thinner hardwood veneer and will get damaged if sanded too much.

You may also need to bleach your floors, depending on how dark the base wood is, which can be hazardous not only to the wooden flooring but to you if done incorrectly. After this, you need to stain the floors! White, watered down paint or stain is usually used if you are DIY-ing. However, this may not give you the perfectly whitewashed look that you are going for, which is why it’s a good idea to consider getting a product that already has a whitewash stain such as some of the Kustom Timber range. Not only would you be saving time, but you’d also be ensuring a great outcome, too.
<h2>How to Clean Whitewashed Wood Floors</h2>
For heavier foot traffic areas of the home especially, a whitewashed wooden floor should have a protective sealant applied in order to seal the surface and make it easier to clean. If you are getting your floors done by a professional, this should be their final step so that the surface is protected. This is because an unsealed floor is harder to clean since sweeping and vacuuming can wear the whitewash from the floor and damage the whitewashed look.

As with all types of timber flooring, be mindful of water and moisture damage! This is the number one enemy of wooden floors, and whitewashed floors are no exception. When cleaning, make sure you are using soft brooms, vacuums, or microfiber cloths to ensure that there are no abrasive surfaces scratching against the finish, and no water seeping into the porous surface of the wood. Keeping an eye on this can go a long way in ensuring that your floors last for years to come.
<h2>Whitewashed Wood Floors Reviews</h2>
It’s always a good idea to find a product/supplier that has a number of reviews of their services available, especially for whitewash style flooring. This is so you can make sure that they are skilled and experienced enough to work on your project and be able to come out with an amazing output that will help you really personalise and make your home your own.

It’s also important to remember that with whitewashed floors, the effect can be quite dramatic. So if you’re after making a small room feel larger, or brightening up an otherwise gloomy-feeling room, or even if you have a lovely mix of furniture that you really want to stand out, it’s a good idea to consider whitewashing your timber floors.
<h2>Whitewash Flooring Ideas</h2>
Because of the qualities of whitewash floors, there could be a very minimalistic feel or even a beachy, rustic aesthetic for a room. This all depends on the techniques and types of whitewash that has been applied. For a more rustic feel, the floors don’t have to be meticulously finished, and some mistakes in the whitewash can actually benefit you if you are looking for a more homey, charming feel.

If you want a minimalistic style, however, the devil is in the details- it has to be meticulously sanded, stained, and sealed! What’s more, couple your whitewashed floors with white walls and the room becomes even more striking yet soft at the same time. And with beautiful furniture pieces, you can really make the most out of the room with just a few additions. No matter the style you’re looking for, we have a product that will fit the need.
