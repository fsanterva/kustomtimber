Simply put, cladding is an extra layer of material that's applied to a building or a surface. It can add to the overall look of any space, which is why a lot of commercial spaces and buildings have exterior cladding installed.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But can you use cladding inside? That's a yes!</span>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benefits of wall cladding</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">High quality interior cladding, is an excellent insulator for the home, creating energy-efficient spaces that are safeguarded against structural deterioration. It is easily applied to any existing surface, whether you’re wanting to change up the look of your ceilings, or even your walls. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Timber wall cladding adds texture to spaces with natural materials, and works with contemporary home designs, spaces with high ceilings, living rooms, and everything in between. It's an excellent way to level up your interior spaces, and with the wide range of internal wall cladding ideas, you're sure to find the right fit for your space, no matter what your interior design goals are.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interior wall cladding ideas</span></h2>
&nbsp;
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Mixed Materials for a Retro-Industrial Wood Panelling</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re after an industrial look, you’ll know that the basic aspects of this design rely on exposed metal, and striking accents that provide an almost warehouse type of feel. For a unique design, veer towards a retro-industrial aesthetic by mixing together different materials for your walls. Timber wall panelling ideas such as designs with a metal accent or trim can provide a splash of lively colour that’s bound to draw the eye.</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Vertical Planks Give Off An Illusion of Height</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Trying to design a room or a new build with a deeper ceiling, or want to give off a feeling of a more open-air space in a small room and don’t have the budget or the time to reconstruct your ceiling height? The image of timber planks applied vertically to the walls provides the illusion of longer walls and higher ceilings, and cladding can be an easy and quick application that will change the look of a small space to your specifications. Work with the natural light from the windows and utilise lighter coloured wood panels to create an airy look.</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Wooden Walls, Floor to Ceiling</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking for other interior wall cladding ideas? If you’d love for your home’s interiors to have a rustic vibe, you may be considering a Scandinavian style, with </span><a href="https://kustomtimber.com.au/services/european-oak-flooring/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">European oak flooring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, walls, and ceiling. Because of the exposed feel that the wood provides, you can ensure a homely vibe that’s easy to achieve by using decorative wall panels.</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Deep, Dark Wooden Walls For A Striking Look</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Colour plays a huge role in the tone of living spaces. And while most designs can feature plain-looking beige walls to give centre-stage to the furniture and other design pieces, consider getting a strikingly bold, dark coloured cladding on the walls to evoke an intensely dramatic look that adds both dimension and character to any space.</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Feature Walls For Feature Pieces</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The panelling look that cladding provides can be a great way to draw the eye to where you want the focal point in the room to be. From a well-designed couch, a fireplace, the bed - the possibilities are endless. Pair simple, cream coloured cladding with other materials like natural stone or marble to really amp up that luxurious look. Or maybe add a reclaimed wood feature wall, and let the rest of the interior cladding accentuate this focal point.</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Transform Simple Pieces Into Feature Points</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the versatility of cladding, you aren’t limited to application on just the walls for further interior design, either. Apply the cladding material to your wooden bedhead, the exterior of your wardrobe, or even the wall where your bed rests against for a statement look. It's a perfect way to add a little extra boost to your bedroom design.</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Add Texture and Dimension</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Monochromatic styles have seen a surge in popularity and for good reason. Relaxing and calming because of the muted tones, one may find that if it lacks texture, the room can also feel a bit flat or uninteresting. To combat this, install timber wall cladding for dimension, to draw the eye and provide a dynamic feel to the room. There's a wide range of wood paneling options available that can help create a unique look for your home interior.</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">8. Coastal Vibes In A Snap</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Walls made from timber automatically exude coastal vibes - think Hamptons-style kitchens and dining rooms, especially when you consider <a href="https://kustomtimber.com.au/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-interior-design-styles/">Australian interior designs</a> of old made full use of bright wooden walls to give off a beachier vibe. Take a note out of Australian interior designer's internal wall cladding ideas, and go for light coloured wall panelling using cladding and bask in the instant coastal feel that your newly renovated rooms give off.</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">9. Strikingly Simple Wood Paneled Recesses</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t have to apply wooden cladding to every wall to give off a striking look. Instead, strategic placing can have an even bigger effect as long as you know where to put it. For any living space, a recess is a great way to provide dimension to any room. Add a wood-panelled design by the use of cladding, and your bathroom, cabinetry, entertainment centre, and open closets immediately look classy and warm.</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">10. Neutral Space? No Problem</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a hallway or a room that has been designed with muted colours such as white walls, pale neutrals, and everything in between, having dark wood cladding on the walls can be just the thing to inject a feeling of richness and character without being too disjointed from the rest of the colour scheme.</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">11. Smart Concealment of Transitional Spaces</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another internal wall cladding idea is to think about your transitional spaces. A refined looking design rests in the details. If you’re after a minimalist look, smooth lines and transitions can really level up the feel of your space. Use wall panels, concealed storage, joins, and even doorways for a streamlined look that brings a subtlety to the design without breaking the bank.</span>
