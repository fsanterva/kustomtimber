The look of <strong>Australian hardwood flooring</strong> provides a sense of style and elegance that is just incomparable. Natural tones, beautiful grain: this flooring has both character and charm, which makes it unsurprising that homeowners place a high value on wooden flooring. Not only is it versatile and stylish, but hardwood is well-known to be durable and long-lasting, which makes it a great investment for families looking to build and design their forever homes with materials that will stand the test of time.

As with most flooring options, there is a wide range available for timber flooring, and each species comes with its own unique look and feel. Whether you’re after solid wood flooring or engineered flooring, it’s a good idea to familiarise yourself with the different types of hardwood species available on the market. This is so you can get a feel for what particular wood tone and grain pattern suits your design needs perfectly. Below, a few of the different species of <strong>timber flooring</strong> available today.
<h2>European Oak</h2>

European Oak is well-known in the field for being a great choice for timber flooring, and it’s easy to see why. With its generally straight grain pattern, slight coarseness and unevenness in texture, and its creamy tones, it lends a classic, elegant look to any room. European Oak is a timeless option that many homeowners veer towards as it also provides great versatility, and can be stained in a variety of different shades to really personalise your <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://kustomtimber.com.au/collection/">wooden flooring</a></span></strong> to your exact specifications not just upon application, but through years of use, should you choose to refinish your flooring.

Kustom Timber uses high quality, ethically sourced European Oak in a number of their collections; namely, the Habitat, Peninsula, Immerse, Como collections, which really underlines the versatility and unique quality of European Oak for all types of applications.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11937" src="https://kustomtimber.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/blackbutt-flooring.jpg" alt="blackbutt flooring" width="1000" height="803" />

Blackbutt is a great choice for homeowners who are wanting the durability of hardwood while having peace of mind that their chosen timber has an easy and relatively quick growth rate. Blackbutt timber is unique in that its bark is rough halfway upwards, where it then proceeds to smooth out into white bark. Generally, its heartwood is yellow with splashes of brown notes, but it is also characteristic of this species to contain pink hues sometimes. With a moderately coarse but even texture, and an interlocking but usually straight grain pattern, it’s a popular choice for homeowners, as its light colour lends itself well to staining and refinishes if necessary.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="https://kustomtimber.com.au/product/blackbutt/">Blackbutt hardwood flooring</a></strong></span> can be seen in Kustom Timber’s Outback collection, which celebrates the timeless, natural beauty of Australian hardwood flooring.
