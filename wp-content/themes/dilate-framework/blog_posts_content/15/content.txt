<h2>Melbourne Floor Sanding FAQs</h2>
Wooden flooring is an elegant and timeless choice for homeowners that wish to really elevate their living spaces. Whether you have just purchased an existing property with hardwood flooring, or have been living at home with timber floors for years, you can agree that the durability of this type of flooring is impeccable. However, as with the hustle and bustle of life, floors can look worse for the wear depending on high foot traffic and general maintenance done. Accidents happen too, and stains and gouges on the wood can really bring down the feel of your flooring.

When this happens, instead of looking into getting new flooring installed, consider <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://kustomtimber.com.au/services/sand-stain-polish/"><strong>floor sanding for your Melbourne</strong> <strong>home</strong></a></span>. Sanding can help rejuvenate tired-looking floors and give you a chance to change the finish, too. You’d be surprised how inexpensive it can be, while also giving you the freedom of choice to spruce up your floor space and bring something new to its appearance if you so wish.
<h2>How long does floor sanding take?</h2>
It is never a good idea to rush <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://kustomtimber.com.au/projects/">home improvement projects</a></span></strong>, especially if it involves your flooring. After all of the furniture has been taken out of the room, depending on the size of the area, and whether or not you choose to hire a contractor trained in floor sanding, the process can be upwards of many hours. This is because sanding is done in stages, first with coarser grit sandpapers, which serve to buff away deep scratches and stains, as well as old finishes, then with progressively finer grit sandpaper to smoothen the surface of the wood and make it easier to varnish and maintain overall.
<h2>Are you allowed to walk on freshly sanded floors?</h2>
As a rule, you shouldn’t be walking on freshly sanded floors. This is because after getting buffed down and smoothed over, these timber floors are basically unprotected. It is best to start working on your floor’s finish, whether that may include staining, varnishing, or both, as soon as possible so as to maintain the integrity of the wood.
<h2>How long before you can put furniture on refinished floors?</h2>
Check your varnish specifications and consult with your floor sander. The answer to this question varies according to the products that you use. In general, you shouldn’t be placing your furniture back into the room until the varnish is cured completely. Depending on the finish, this can take days or weeks, and ideally you should leave the room alone during this period. However, it is understandable to want to replace your furniture as soon as possible and make use of your newly rejuvenated room, so it’s best to ask your contractor what their estimated curing time is and when they can give you the go-ahead to start using the affected room again.
