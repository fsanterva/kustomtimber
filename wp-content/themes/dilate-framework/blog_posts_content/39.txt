As experts in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://kustomtimber.com.au/">timber flooring Melbourne</a></span>, we love seeing the newest design trends making an appearance in homes and the versatility of engineered timber means that it be integrated into any space. So, what’s on the horizon in 2019 when it comes to home design? Today, we’ll be looking at some of the home design predictions you can expect to see in the near future.
<h2>1.      Grey timber flooring</h2>
While timber flooring never goes out of style and you’re safe with any colour choice, we’ll likely be seeing more grey timber flooring in 2019. The neutral tone of grey timber combines perfectly with contrasting bright colours and offers a sophisticated, modern finish.
<h2>2.      Sustainable materials</h2>
With an increasing emphasis on eco-conscious design, it’s no surprise that sustainable materials will be making their way into home interiors in 2019. Natural textiles can be used to great effect and add texture and interest.
<h2>3.      Matte black</h2>
While grey accents have been popular this year, in 2019 we can expect to see more matte black appearing in homes. Matte black offers a sleek, striking contrast and can be worked into home design through lighting, furniture and accessories without looking too stark.
<h2>4.      Curved furniture</h2>
As a move away from the sharp lines of furniture which have been appearing in modern homes in recent years, we’re now seeing a move towards eye catching, curved designs in furniture. This is a nod to the popularity of Art Deco design which adds a touch of glamour to interiors.
<h2>5.      Calming pastels</h2>
Pastels having been making their way into interior design and this trend will continue in 2019. These colours give a more relaxed, calming vibe compared to more striking colours and are particularly popular in the kitchen. Think pastel blues, greens and pinks.
<h2>6.      Gold accents</h2>
Metals such as copper and brass have been very popular and we can expect to see gold becoming a popular design choice in 2019. Bright gold accents are the perfect contrast for natural materials and add a sense of warmth and opulence.
<h2>7.      Natural greenery</h2>
The trend towards greenery in the home doesn’t look like it’s going anywhere and plants will continue to be a style staple in the home. There are plenty of hardy plants which will love a spot inside or you can opt for some artificial greenery.
