The home is an integral part of any individual’s life. It is where one returns at the end of the day to rest and recuperate, bond with family members, and relax. It is well-known that residing in spaces that are well-decorated and well-designed contribute quite well to the enjoyment and peace that a person feels when settling in at the end of the day, which is why homeowners take their time to design a home that not only suits their tastes and styles but will fit their lifestyle, too. And if you’re considering hardwood <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://kustomtimber.com.au/services/installation/"><strong>floor installation in Melbourne</strong></a></span>, there’s a lot that goes into the decision of using timber for your home’s flooring.
<h2>Subfloor</h2>
The subfloor is the area where the wooden flooring will be installed. This entails joists, concrete slabs, and a sheet flooring of either particleboard or plywood before any timber can be installed.
<h2>Which Rooms Require Hardwood</h2>
While an all hardwood floor home can be charming in its own way, it’s important to note the limitations of timber when it comes to certain rooms in the house. To maintain the wood’s longevity and durability, opt to use different flooring options for areas that will see moisture and humidity regularly: namely, bathrooms and kitchens, as moisture and humidity can adversely affect the durability of hardwood, making it warp and swell from prolonged contact. Bedrooms, living spaces, and the like will benefit from the strength of hardwood flooring, however.
<h2>Lifestyle</h2>
Do you have members of the family with allergies? What type of maintenance are you willing to regularly do for your flooring? Wooden floors are great for allergy sufferers as they are easy to clean, and any dust and debris is easy to sweep away and prevent from accumulating due to the surface of the wood. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://kustomtimber.com.au/kustom-timber-blog/how-to-clean-and-maintain-wooden-floorboards/">Floor maintenance for hardwood</a></span> mostly entails using a sweeper with soft bristles and at times a slightly damp cloth to wipe away stains or spills before wicking away moisture with a dry cloth.
<h2>Species, Finishing, and Staining Choices</h2>
Homeowners need to consider what type of species they think will suit their preferences and style the most. Some species, like European Oak, have a light to cream colouring with little to faint grain patterns, which will provide a light base for any home interior design. But some people like their homes with darker timber for warmth and depth, and for these the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="https://kustomtimber.com.au/product/jarrah/">Jarrah</a></strong></span> or <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="https://kustomtimber.com.au/product/chestnut/">Chestnut</a></strong></span> species can provide that extra elegance you’re wanting for.

It’s important to note, too, that you aren’t limited to the natural tones of these species - you can opt to stain your wood for a specific shade, for example, which will go well with your chosen interior design while also showcasing the unique beauty of the hardwood you have picked for your home. So if you’ve got your heart set on the unique characteristics of a lighter-toned hardwood, but want the welcoming warmth of a dark hardwood floor, there’s always the option of staining your timber before and even after your Melbourne floor installation.
