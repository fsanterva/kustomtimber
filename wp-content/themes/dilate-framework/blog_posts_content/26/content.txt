<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to flooring, nothing quite compares to the striking elegance and hard wearing character of timber flooring. Having real wood underfoot not only elevates the look of any interior, but comes with a wide range of advantages that homeowners are enjoying more and more. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you're cost-savvy but still wanting the durability of hardwood flooring, you've probably explored different flooring options and heard of <a href="https://kustomtimber.com.au/">engineered timber flooring</a>. Perhaps you're interested to know if it measures up to solid timber planks when it comes to longevity and aesthetic. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below, we list the many advantages of engineered wood flooring, from durability, quality, to its surprising affordability, too.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Same look to solid timber</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, wooden flooring has been solidified as the premiere flooring option for homeowners. Throughout history we've seen the natural beauty that solid wood floors provide to a wide range of interior spaces. However, the process to install, as well as the cost, time constraints, and sustainability considerations can be a dealbreaker for some. If you love the look of hardwood floors, it doesn't mean that solid timber is the only option. Engineered timber flooring offers the same elegant look of solid hardwood flooring, because the top veneer is constructed from genuine hardwood. This means that you get the natural character of the woods that you're after in an engineered flooring plank.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Aesthetically pleasing, with a wide range of styles</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The beauty of natural wooden flooring is that no two pieces of timber are the same. The knots and flaws embedded in the wood only serve to add a striking elegance and beauty to your flooring. The unique character of genuine hardwood in the form of engineered timber floors provides a stunning aesthetic that not only looks good immediately after installation, but is versatile enough to be adaptable to your changing interior design over the years. After all, it's not just durability you're after, it's style, too! It's also important to note that engineered floorboards are also available in wider plank sizes compared to <a href="https://kustomtimber.com.au/collection/">solid timber floorboards</a>, which makes it easier for you to really personalise your flooring to your own unique aesthetic.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And with a wide range of options and styles available, you're sure to find the perfect flooring for your needs.</span>
<h2><b>Strong, durable, long-lasting</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Engineered timber floors were created to be durable and long-wearing, lasting for generations. Its construction of a top veneer of solid hardwood means you get the solid wood flooring look that you wish to achieve, and its core layers of high density wood provide added strength. This means that, compared to traditional hardwood, engineered hardwood flooring is lightweight yet strong, able to withstand heavy foot traffic in the home or in commercial spaces through decades of wear.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Stable, with moisture and heat-resistance</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The construction of engineered wood flooring is designed to ensure that your floors are less prone to warping and moisture damage, which solid timber flooring is susceptible to if not maintained properly. This specialised construction for engineered wood floors means that it is well-suited to Australian weather and humidity conditions, as the multiple layers comprising the boards minimise the risk of expansion and contraction due to humidity and moisture. An engineered timber board is not as prone to cracking and warping, making it a great choice, especially if you're looking for a flooring option that will age gracefully in the years to come.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Refinishing Options Galore</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As time goes by, wooden flooring is known to show wear and tear. One of the reasons why solid planks are a popular option is because it can be refinished to look like new, even after decades of use. A common misconception is that engineered timber flooring cannot be refinished like solid hardwood boards, but this is not the case. High-quality engineered floorboards have a thicker top layer of hardwood that can be refinished to bring new life to tired floors if required.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Affordability</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because engineered floorboards have a hardwood top layer, and layers of plywood as a base, constructing and installing these planks is a more cost-effective way of achieving wooden floors as compared to solid hardwood flooring.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Sustainability</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you're after an environmentally-friendly flooring option, engineered flooring might be the one for you. Compared to solid timber, engineered floorboards utilise a hardwood top layer and bottom layers that are made using sustainable wood options. This means that it's a sustainable flooring solution, especially when you choose a manufacturer that only offers ethically sourced hardwood for their engineered timber. Plus, because you're able to refinish your flooring, you won't be wasting valuable resources down the line, ensuring that you're making the most out of your wooden floors.</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><b>Health benefits</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of wood's natural composition, engineered timber is easy to clean and maintain, especially when compared to flooring options such as carpet. This is because timber floors don't harbour microorganisms like dust mites, or trap dirt, dust, or other allergens, meaning it's an allergy-friendly choice for the family.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Easy installation</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Installing raw and untreated solid hardwood floors can be a lengthy and difficult process, especially for the inexperienced. Engineered flooring makes installation easier as compared to solid timber, because it can be installed directly onto the subfloor, or as floating floors. It's a quicker way to achieve that wood flooring look without the stress and mess, so you can enjoy your floors without the wait. Make sure to consult with an experienced professional to ensure that your engineered floorboards are not only of the highest quality, but are installed properly, too, so you can get the most out of your floors for generations to come.
