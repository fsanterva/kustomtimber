Whether you’re having new floors installed or are looking to have your existing floors sanded and polished, one of the decisions you need to make is what finish you want – gloss, satin or matte. As the experts in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="http://kustomtimber.com.au/services/sand-stain-polish/">floor sanding Melbourne</a></strong></span>, we get a lot of people asking us whether they should opt for a matte finish for their floors or go for a more traditional gloss or a satin look. Today, we’ll be exploring the pros and cons of choosing a matte finish for your wooden floors so you can get the look you’re after.
<h2>Pros of a matte finish</h2>
A matte finish only has around a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paint_sheen" rel="nofollow">10% to 25% sheen</a></span> <em>(can be different on different temperatures</em>) which means that it reflects the least light out of all of the finish options for your floors. Far from looking dull, this gives a modern feel which also adds warmth to space. Matte floors look great with more minimalist designs, such as the increasingly popular Scandinavian style, as well as Hamptons style homes. A matte finish also looks very effective when paired with wire-brushed floorboards.

As well as the benefits of matte floors from an aesthetic perspective, matte floors also have the ability to hide scratches and damage which makes them perfect for high traffic areas where you want to hide imperfections. For this reason, matte floors are a popular choice for the kitchen and living areas. Due to the low sheen, matte floors are also easier to spot repair.
<h2>Cons of a matte finish</h2>
One of the main things you need to remember about a matte finish is that it’s not quite as effective at protecting your floors from water damage compared to glossier finishes. This means you need to be careful to clean up any liquid spills as soon as they occur to avoid damage. A glossier finish also tends to offer your floors more protection from damage – although, as we’ve mentioned, it doesn’t hide the damage as well as matte!

A matte look also often isn’t the best fit if you have a more traditional style, where a finish with more gloss is often more appropriate. If you prefer a slightly glossier look, a satin finish is a good compromise between matte and high gloss. A satin finish offers a 35% to 40% so you still get the benefits of a glossy look without it showing up too much damage like high gloss tends to.
