<h2>Timber floors are high maintenance</h2>
A lot of people think that wooden floors are difficult to maintain and take up a lot of a lot of time. The reality is that timber floors are easy to maintain – all it takes is some simple maintenance. Give your floors a quick sweep each day to get rid of accumulated dirt and give them a proper vacuum every week or so. Just make sure you clean up any water spills to avoid damage.

While it’s true that timber floors can cost more initially compared to other flooring options such as carpet, they actually cost you less money in the long run due to their longevity. Also, engineered timber flooring is more cost effective than solid timber options while giving you the same benefits of hardwood.
<h2>Timber floors give a cold feel</h2>
Because timber is a hard flooring option, a lot of people worry that it will give a cold feel to the house like other hard floors such as tiling. However, the beauty of timber flooring is that bring a sense of warmth to the home and aren’t as cold underfoot as tiles or slate.
<h2>Timber floors can’t be used in wet areas</h2>

<h2>Timber floors aren’t sustainable</h2>
We completely understand why timber flooring has a reputation for being unsustainable. After all, doesn’t it use slow growing hardwood?
