When it comes to aesthetics, there’s a big difference between a bit of character and plain old damage with your timber floors. Sanding back and refinishing your timber floors can give them a whole new lease on life but many people wonder when they need to give their floors a facelift. After all, sanding back too often can reduce the life of your floorboards. As the experts in floor sanding and polishing, we’re sharing the tops signs which may indicate that floor sanding is required.
<h2>Your floor looks scuffed and dull</h2>
The basic rule of thumb is that you need to have your floors sanded back every 10 to 15 years but it really depends on the look of the floors themselves. If they still look immaculate, leave them be! However, over time many timber floors start showing signs of surface damage such as scuffs and scratches and begin to look dull. If your <strong>timber floors</strong> have been looking sad for a while, a bit of sand and polish could be just what they need. If you’ve never had your floors sanded before, you can get an expert in to take a look at your floors and ensure there’s enough thickness in the boards to allow them to be sanded.
<h2>Your floor has obvious signs of damage</h2>
Another situation when you should consider having your floors sanded back is if they’re showing signs of more serious damage. This could mean aesthetic damage such as deep scratches or gouges. In some cases, it could mean more serious damage such as cupping or peaking, signs of water damage, and sagging. Although many issues can be fixed through <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://kustomtimber.com.au/services#sanding-polishing"><strong>sanding and polishing</strong></a></span>, always get the experts in to take a look at the more serious damage to ensure that your floors are structurally sound.
<h2>You hate the colour or finish of your floors</h2>
In some situations, your floorboards may be in perfect condition with no visible signs of wear. However, the problem could be that you can’t stand the look of the timber. Whether the colour is far too dark for your house or you have the yellow, glossy look which was all the rage in the 90s, it’s understandable that you may need a facelift. In these situations, the floors can be sanded back and then a new colour and finish can be applied to transform the look of your floors.
