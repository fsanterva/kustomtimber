When it comes to choosing material for your staircase, most people opt for either timber or carpet. So, which one is the best choice? If you’re thinking of <a href="http://kustomtimber.com.au/services/stairs/">installing timber stairs in your Melbourne</a> home but aren’t sure whether this will be the right fit, we’re here to help. Let’s take a look at the difference between timber and carpeted stairs.
<h2>Carpeted Stairs</h2>
Carpet is a common choice for staircases and a lot of people opt for this choice is their upstairs area is also carpeted. One of the main benefits of carpet for your stairs is that it provides a softer surface in the event of falls. It also absorbs more noise compared to <strong>timber</strong>. However, one of the biggest downsides to carpet is that it’s difficult to keep clean compared to timber. This is particularly an issue given the heavy foot traffic that your stairs receive day after day. Stains are inevitable on carpeted stairs, especially if you have pets or children in the house.

You’ll need to vacuum on a regular basis to remove dirt and debris from the carpet and professional steam cleaning is also required. Because of the allergens which can become trapped in carpet, it’s essential that you keep on top of cleaning. Wear and tear is more of an issue with carpeted stairs and it’s better to choose a low pile carpet so it doesn’t become matted.
<h2>Timber Stairs</h2>
One of the immediate benefits of <a href="http://kustomtimber.com.au/services/stairs/"><strong>timber stairs</strong> </a>is the aesthetics. Timber takes the look of your staircase to the next level and with the right colour and finish, can blend seamlessly with any style. Maintenance is also simple as the timber won’t trap dirt like carpet does – all you need to do is sweep regularly and spot clean when needed. Timber stairs are also treated with non-slip products which makes them very safe.

When you choose good quality timber for your stairs, you can take advantage of the fact that it’s highly durable and able to stand up to daily punishment. Timber also has the added advantage of being able to be sanded back and refinished. This allows you to change the look of your stairs over time if you want something different and you can also get rid of built-up scratches and damage for stairs which look like new again.
